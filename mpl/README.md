# "Modern Programming Languages Lecture Projects" 

This folder contains Python exercises and mini-projects created during the **Modern Programming Languages** course.

## biggest.py
This Python script compares two integers and prints which is larger (or if they're equal), accepting input either from command-line arguments or interactive prompts.

## count_words.py
This Python module provides two functions: count_words() to count words in a text file and find_and_replace() to replace all occurrences of a target word in a file.

## dices.py
This Python code simulates rolling two dice 999 times and displays a frequency distribution of their sums from 2 to 12.

## evenfibonacci.py
This code calculates the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci numbers that do not exceed four million (or whatever you want to set up to).

## graphDrawing13thNov.py
This Python code plots both sine and cosine functions on the same graph over the interval [-1, 10] using matplotlib with customized styling.

## lesson1.py
This Python script defines two functions to find the largest and smallest of three numbers, then prints the minimum of three randomly generated integers.

## listWithRandom.py
This Python code generates and prints a list of 4 random integers between 1 and 10 inclusive.

## main.py
This Python code generates a list of 4 random integers between 1 and 50 and prints it, while the commented-out section shows example operations on a sample list.

## main2.py
This Python code defines a function `isPoli()` that checks if a list is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.

## multiplesof3or5.py
This Python code calculates and prints the sum of all natural numbers below 1000 that are multiples of either 3 or 5.

## test.py
Testing if Python works lol

## wordFreqFinder.py
This Python code counts how many times the letter 'a' (or any letter) appears in a given text and calculates its frequency relative to the total character count.
